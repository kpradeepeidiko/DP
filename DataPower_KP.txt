Datapower Services:
=====================
1. Web Application Firewall:
----------------------------
--> Used to create proxy-based firewall for actual application which is running backend of any organization.
--> Suppose an application is running on backend organizational server and you want to publish your application to real-time 
	consumers, but at the same you don't want to take risk of exposing your IP and your DNS name.So, in this case you can 
	create a firewall(dummy IP and Port) for your backend application using Web Application Firewall.
	
When to use Web Servie Proxy(WSP) and XML Firewall:
---------------------------------------------------
All soap WSDL have service contract, based on that server contract we invoke our logic.
so, when we have service contract we wil choose WSP.

Think about REST, REST doesn't comes with service contract, so in that case XML Firewall is the best fit.(We can also use SOAP
but we have to have where and when we use scenarios)

Both WPS and XML firewall supports HTTP and HTTPS

XML Firewall:
-------------
-->Fire Types: 
	1. Loopback-Proxy
	2. Static-Backend
	
	Static-backend:
	---------------
	You are going to invoke datapower xml firewall which is actually having backend service running, Going to call backend 
	service in our organization or outside of an organization.
	Example video:

	Loopback-Proxy:
	---------------
	In case if you don't have any backend service, the datapower act's as server for you, so whatever request you sending 
	datapower receives the request and process the request and gives the response back to it.
	

	
	
Multi Protocol Gateway:
-----------------------
--> It provides various protocol bridging.
--> Supports MQ, JMS,SFTP, FTP, etc
--> Whenever you want to use asynchronous communication of web-service or web-service with fire and forget scenario, in that
	case multi protocal gateway usefull.
