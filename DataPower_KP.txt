Datapower Services:
=====================
1. Web Application Firewall:
----------------------------
--> Used to create proxy-based firewall for actual application which is running backend 
    of any organization.
--> Suppose an application is running on backend organizational server and you want to 
    publish your application to real-time consumers, but at the same you don't want to 
	take risk of exposing your IP and your DNS name.So, in this case you can create a 
	firewall(dummy IP and Port) for your backend application using Web Application Firewall.
	
When to use Web Servie Proxy(WSP) and XML Firewall:
---------------------------------------------------
All soap WSDL have service contract, based on that server contract we invoke our logic.
so, when we have service contract we wil choose WSP.

Think about REST, REST doesn't comes with service contract, so in that case XML Firewall 
is the best fit.(We can also use SOAP but we have to have where and when we use scenarios)

Both WPS and XML firewall supports HTTP and HTTPS

XML Firewall:
-------------
-->Fire Types: 
	1. Loopback-Proxy
	2. Static-Backend
	
	Static-backend:
	---------------
	You are going to invoke datapower xml firewall which is actually having backend service 
	running, Going to call backend service in our organization or outside of an organization.
	Example video: 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_DPLbK9NeE
	
	Loopback-Proxy:
	---------------
	In case if you don't have any backend service, the datapower act's as server for you, 
	so whatever request you sending datapower receives the request and process the request 
    and gives the response back to it.
	
	
Multi Protocol Gateway:
-----------------------
--> It provides various protocol bridging.
--> Supports MQ, JMS,SFTP, FTP, etc
--> Whenever you want to use asynchronous communication of web-service or web-service with 
    fire and forget scenario, in that case multi protocal gateway usefull.
